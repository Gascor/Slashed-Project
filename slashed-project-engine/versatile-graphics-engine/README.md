# Versatile Graphics Engine

## Overview
The Versatile Graphics Engine is a flexible and powerful graphics engine designed for game development. It supports various data inputs for rendering 3D objects and provides a robust framework for creating visually rich environments.

## Features
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Utilizes OpenGL for high-performance rendering of 3D graphics.
- **Object Management**: Easily add and manage various 3D objects such as cubes and spheres.
- **Camera Control**: Intuitive camera controls for navigating the 3D space.
- **Shader Support**: Custom vertex and fragment shaders for advanced rendering techniques.
- **Texture Management**: Load and apply textures to objects for enhanced visual fidelity.
